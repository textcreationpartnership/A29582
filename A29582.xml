            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Religion, as the Men of old time themſelves have taught us, requireth of us in effect,</p>
               <p>That we ſhould yield full obedience unto God.</p>
               <p>Full obedience requireth that we dedicate unto the Glory of God</p>

               <p>That which Religion is to get for us is Salvation;</p>
               <p>For to ſpeak properly, what is Religion?</p>
               <p>An Art, or skill, if I may ſo term it, how to ſave Men,</p>
               <p>And wherein conſiſteth this Art?</p>

               <p n="5">5. Reaſon alſo leadeth us to the Second Point.</p>
               <p>For who is he that concludeth not with himſelf.</p>
               <p>That the Creature which offendeth his Creator deſerveth to be rooted out?</p>
               <p>That is to ſay that Sin ingendreth Death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thus far may all Religions come,</p>
               <p>And all Ceremonies ordained by Man,</p>
               <p>As Prayers,</p>
               <p>Sacrifices,</p>

               <p>But what is all this but a bringing of us to Hell gate?</p>
               <p>Or rather a ſhewing of Paradiſe unto us a far off?</p>
               <p>But there is an horrible, and infinite Gulph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and it,</p>
               <p>Which Man,</p>
               <p>And all the whole World can neither fill up.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is to be obſerved, that there is a double Antiquity,</p>
               <p>One is Primary</p>
               <p>And the other is Secondary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Primary Antiquity is that which was from the beginning, though diſcontinued, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the corruption of Times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondary Antiquity is that, which indeed is aged, and gray-headed, but yet reacheth not to the Spring-head.</p>
               <p>Thus our Saviour Chriſt controlleth the Law of Divorce <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8. Though it was aged, and of long continuance; Even two thouſand years old: Yet <hi>non ſic fuit ab initio.</hi> It was not ſo in the beginning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In regard of this it is truly ſaid of <hi>Tertullian verum quod primum, falſum quod posterius.</hi> That which is firſt is alwayes true, and that which cometh later is falſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning Antiquity it is to be obſerved, that no Antiquity, be it never ſo ancient and hoare-headed, is to be reverenced or regarded, if it be not grounded upon the truth of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that which ſeemeth Novelty, if it bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93664:6"/>Scripture for its warrant is truly Ancient: and hath true, certain, and unreſiſtable Authority.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is given by <hi>Aquinas</hi> 2. <hi>part. q.</hi> 97. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. Becauſe the Law of God proceedeth from the will of God; and therefore may not be altered by Cuſtome proceeding from the will of Man.</p>

In that regard very well doth S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> write <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Caecilium.</hi> If only Chriſt is to be heard, we ought not to regard what any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us hath thought fit to be done, but what Chriſt who is before all hath firſt done.

               <head>That God is the onely Authour of the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, or Belief; we prove it by the following Arguments.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe 1. is taken from the Nature of Faith.</p>
               <p>For all the Doctrines of Faith, in regard of the matter which is to be believed muſt have a certain, infallible, and undoubted Truth:</p>
               <p>Now it is the property of God alone to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true of his own nature. Let God be true, but every man a lyar, ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <p>And therefore God alone is the Author of the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 2. Argument is taken from the Quality of the Articles of Faith;</p>
               <p>For the proper documents and Doctrines of Faith do exceed the capacity, and apprehenſion of the Creature. And therefore they could not be revealed but onely by the Creator.</p>
               <p>Such is the Doctrine of the Trinity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the unity of an Eſſence. Such is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Eternal Birth of the Son of God. Such that of the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt. And ſuch that of the hypoſtaticall union of the two Natures of Chriſt, Divine and Humane.</p>
               <p>And ſuch are all other Articles concerning Faith properly, and ſtrictly taken, which in that they are above the naturall knowledge of the Creature, cannot be known by us, but by the ſupernaturall Revelation of the Creator.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93664:7"/>
               <p>Of all them this of Chriſt may be ſaid, Fleſh and Bloud hath not revealed theſe things unto mankind; but God the Father which is in Heaven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The 3. Argument is taken from the reward of Faith, and the puniſhment propunded to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and infidelity,</p>
               <p>Which doe manifeſtly argue that it belongeth to God alone, to frame and preſcribe to Men, Articles, and dogmes, concerning beliefe and Faith. For the reward propounded to Faith, is Eternall Life. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.36. <hi>And that is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom.</hi> 6.23. And the puniſhment denounced againſt infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is Eternall Death; Which puniſhment God alone is able to inflict. Chriſt teacheth it <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.28. in theſe words <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>fear him which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell.</hi> He teacheth it alſo, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. when he ſayes, <hi>that he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The 2. Argument is taken From the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, And Puniſhment, Annexed to the Works of Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p>For the Works of Divine Worſhip Piouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, have from the Munificence of God, a Promiſe of Eternal Reward:</p>

               <p>That God Alone, who is the Lord of Life and</p>

               <p>By the Empire of a Law-giver.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The 3. Argument is drawn from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The 4. Argument is,</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Works of Worſhip depend from the Will of God, who is to be Worſhipped:</p>

               <p>The Ark was removed,</p>

               <p>And by him was renewed the Religious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant between God, and the People.</p>

               <p>If any one doubts of the exerciſe of the Power of Chriſtian Emperours about the matter of Religion, let him read the <hi>Code,</hi>

               <p n="6">6. To the two former Arguments let us join a third one to prove that the Supream Authority concerning Religion, doth belong to the Prince, and Soveraign Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>This Argument is taken from the neceſſity, or at leaſt from the convenience of the Thing.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very neceſſary that there be one to whom the Supream authority doth belong to Injoin that which belongeth to Religion, To forbid the Things that are hurtful and contrary to Religion, And to puniſh thoſe that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious; For the outward worſhip of God ſhall vaniſh away, Hereſies will riſe, and Increaſe, as alſo Blaſphemies, unleſſe there be one armed with the Sword, who may by fear, and by a coactive power, reſtrain the perverſe, and wicked.</p>
               <p>This cannot be done by Eccleſiaſtical Perſons;</p>
               <p>For their Office is to preach, to exhort, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and by Spiritual Cenſures to Correct.</p>
               <p>But they bear not the Sword; And they are deprived of that Supream Power, which by the fear of puniſhment may contain the Impious, and wicked in their Duty.</p>
               <p>Therefore the very outward face of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Commonwealth ſhall not be retained, if we exclude the Civil Magiſtrate from the Supream Authority concerning Religion.</p>

                  <p>That ſince the firſt Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> there hath been but one way to attain to the fruition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93664:17"/>And this way hath been the Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Mediator. See thereof <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>Chapt.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11. and 10.43.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore the doctrine of thoſe is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, who teach a three-fold way to attain unto Salvation; Namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One to thoſe who did live before the written Law, by the obſervation of the Law of Nature.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Reaſon why ſuch Doctrine is to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and exploded, is becauſe the Faithful, and Believers, under the Old Teſtament, have had Redemption in Chriſt, by his blood, which was to be ſhed, As we have by his Bloud which is ſhed. For the Expiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt hath had a ſaving vertue, not onely ſince it was offered unto God upon the Croſs, But even from the Eternal Decree of God.</p>
                  <p>And the Efficacy thereof hath been as well before, as after it was exhibited:</p>
                  <p>In which regard it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>That he is the ſame yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. Chriſt is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi>
                  </p>

               <p n="1">1. TO Judge aright of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we ſay that there is great difference between that which is now, And that which was in the time of the Apoſtles, And ſome Ages after their Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which was in the Time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was Pure and Orthodox, <hi>So that her Faith, was ſpoken of throughout the whole world,</hi> Rom. 1.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After the Death of the Apoſtles, during ſome Ages, ſhe hath been alſo a true Church; But not the onely True Church. Not the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or Univerſal Church, But a Part of the ſame;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93664:21"/>As was the Church of Greece, of <hi>Syria,</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> And of other Places; She hath been a True Church, but not ſo Pure as in the Apoſtles time; Errors betimes, having begun to creep in her.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which is now, is an Impure and Heretical Church, And more Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical than any one that ever was before; Since the Plague of Antichriſtianiſme have ſticked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, it is no more the Chaſte Spouſe of Chriſt, but an Harlot, And an Adultereſſe. It is no more a ſound and vigorous body, but a body full of ulcers, and ſoars. In a word, ſhe is no more Pure and Orthodox, as ſhe was before, but Impure, and Heterodox.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Which we prove by two ſtrong, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Arguments;</p>
               <p>The 1. is, becauſe the greater part of her Faith, and belief is contary to holy Scriptures;</p>
               <p>And conſequently is meer Hereſie.</p>
               <p>The 2. is, becauſe a great part of the Ancient Hereſies which have been condemned by the Ancient, and Orthodox Church, are received in her, and approved by her.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I have ſaid, 1. That the now Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Impure, &amp; Heretical becauſe the greater part of her Faith, and belief is contrary to holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scriptures forbids the uſe of Images in matter of Religion, and Divine Worſhip. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives, and maintains them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture teacheth us, that the bloud of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93664:21"/>Chriſt doth cleanſe us from all ſin, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth eſtabliſh another Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture teacheth us, that of our ſelves we are not able to think any good Thing, but but that all our ſufficiencie is from God.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will, that by the ſtrength of our Free-will we may do good works, And make the ſaid ſtrength to cooperate with the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture will, that we pray, and ſpeak in the Church in a known Tongue, All the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in an unknown Language.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scripture doth ordain, that in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper all drink of the Cup:</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath forbid it to the Laity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Scripture preſents us Jeſus Chriſt as the only Mediator between God and Men:</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth forge a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Mediatours, who are to help us with their Merits, and with their Suffrages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Scripture doth warn us concerning Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>That the Heaven muſt receive him until the time of reſtitution of all things:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will in ſome ſort make him to come down every day from Heaven in a million of Places; And moreover, expoſes him under the accidents of bread to divers igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93664:22"/>
               <p n="8">8. In a word, there is no Propoſition mentioned againſt us in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof we may not be able to find the Antitheſis in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>In that regard there are many to be found in the ſaid Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are aſham'd of the aboveſaid Errors:</p>
               <p>And except the brainleſſe Spirits, and reſolved to maintain even the groſeſt Abuſes, few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will there be found who entirely keep their Religion, And in ſome Points thereof do not find ſomething wanting.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I have ſaid, 2. that the now Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Impure and Heretical, becauſe a great part of the Ancient Hereſies, which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Ancient and Orthodox Church, are received in her, and approved by her.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hereſies meet in her, and do compound a part of Popery, As all the Waters of Rivers and Springs do meet in the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Devil hath made them to riſe up again upon the ſtage in the Roman Church with ſome ſmall diſguiſing.</p>
               <p>Her ſo inſolent contempt, and debaſing of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures ſhe hath common with all kinds of Hereticks, to whom ſuch a thing is uſual.</p>
               <p>She doth borrow from the Phariſees the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writton Traditions, And the Merit of Works.</p>
               <p>She borroweth from the <hi>Baſilidians,</hi> and the <hi>Carpoeratians</hi> the worſhipping of Images.</p>
               <p>She hath from the <hi>Marcoſians,</hi> of whom <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93664:22"/>doth ſpeak, And from the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Vigilius</hi> doe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently diſpute the Error of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>She hath from the <hi>Meſſalians,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Euchetes,</hi> her vain repetitions of Prayers by number.</p>
               <p>She hath from the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> the <hi>Tatianites,</hi> the <hi>Eucratites,</hi> the <hi>Priſcilianiſts,</hi> and <hi>Eustachians</hi> her Faſtings, her Abſtinences, her Vow of Poverty, Her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Meats, And her Law of <hi>Celibat,</hi> or Single Life:</p>
               <p>By all which is accompliſhed the Prophecie of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which we have 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and <hi>Pepuſians,</hi> ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Women to Baptiſe.</p>
               <p>With the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> ſhe doth eſtabliſh Free-will, The Merit of Works, The Perfection of Holineſſe, whereof the Monks do principally boaſt, Adding thereunto of their own the Works of Supererogation as a mark of a Supream arrogancie.</p>
               <p>With the <hi>Manichees,</hi> though under another conſideration in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> ſhe hath cut off the uſe of the Cup.</p>
               <p>It were a thing too tedious to particulariſe more upon this matter.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From the aboveſaid, it manifeſtly appears that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Heretical, yea above all others who ever have been Heretical.</p>
               <p>Becauſe ſhe is not infected onely with two
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93664:23"/>or three Hereſies, but with a great number and multitude of them.</p>
               <p>And becauſe her maladies are not ſmall and ſlight, but the poiſon of Hereſie hath thruſt it ſelf through her whole body, having almoſt corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Articles of Faith;</p>
               <p>Which cauſeth us to ſay with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> c. 1.21, 22. <hi>How is the faithful City become an harlot? it was full of judgement, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lodged in it, but now murderers; Thy ſilver is become droſſe, thy wine mixt with water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſame alſo cauſes us to acknowledge that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath onely an outward ſhew;</p>
               <p>Her faireſt is the frontiſpiece and fore front, all covered with magnificent Titles, But within it is nothing elſe but falſehood, and Corruption.</p>
               <p>She is like unto the Temples of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old, which outwardly were fair and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; But within nothing was to be found but Cats, and Crocodiles, and Serpents, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beaſts; fitter for a Den, then for ſuch a Temple.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

               </p>
               <p>Since the thouſand years ended of the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chains of Satan by Jeſus Chriſt, in the

               <p n="4">4. The Apparel and Ornaments of Antichriſt are Scarlet, and Purple, Gold, Jewels, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, which the Popes wear, eſpecially on high daies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Time of Antichriſt his riſing is foretold to be after the Diviſion of the Roman Empire; after whch it appears by all ſtories, that the Pope grew to his greatneſſe.</p>

               <p>This agreeth to the Papacy and Pope, who reſembleth Chriſt, whoſe Vicar he calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and arrogateth to himſelf Chriſts double power, both Kingly and Prieſtly. He exerciſeth alſo the power of the firſt Beaſt, to wit, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, deſcribed by ſeven Heads and ten Horns; becauſe as the firſt Beaſt the Roman Empire by power, and temporal Authority: So the Pope, by policy, and Spiritual Juriſdiction, ruleth over a great part of the world.</p>

               <p n="3">3. And onely after the tenth Age had raiſed themſelves above their Degree.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet not ſo much that they durſt make themſelves equals unto Biſhops, unto whom they were held to be inferiours, until the year of Grace, a thouſand and two hundred.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But from that time; Not onely have they eſteemed themſelves to be Equals unto Biſhops, but moreover have raiſed themſelves above them. So that now they hold them for ſervants in their Houſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He concluded, That the Church ſhould never be reformed, untill Biſhops, and Cardinals were brought again to the Rank due unto each of them.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Cardinals more particularly.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOt one word can be found in the Antient Church concerning Cardinals, ſave in this ſignification, That Cardinal Prieſt did ſignifie the Parſon, or Rector of one of the Pariſhes of the Biſhoprick.</p>
                  <p>Then Cardinal Prieſt was as much as principal Prieſt, even as ſome virtues are called Cardinal virtues. And ſome winds Cardinal winds, that is to ſay, Firſt, and Principal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And this Title was uſed, not onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo in other great Archiepiſcopal Cities, principally at <hi>Milan,</hi> where <hi>Sigonius</hi> reporteth,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93664:54"/>that there were 22. Cardinals, about the end of the ſeventh book.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And there being many Prieſts in one Pariſh, he that was the firſt in Order, and the Rector of the Pariſh, as hath been ſaid, was called the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, or Cardinal Prieſt. For that comes to one, as <hi>Pandulphus Piſanus</hi> doth teach, and after him <hi>Onuphrius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And at this time all Cardinals are Prieſts or Deacons of ſome of the pariſhes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that regard they ſate at the laſt in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; As namely in the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> And in the Council of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, And the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church in her Remonſtrances to the Council of <hi>Canſtance</hi> ſaies theſe words: Cardinals are the Rectors, or Parſons of the Parochial Churches at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have their Dignities in their pariſhes; and their Firſt, and principal Office is, To hear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, To preach, and to Baptize, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſaith in <hi>Libro de Cardinali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> That when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 2. about the year 1046. had ſtrengthened the Papal Majeſty. <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. about the year 1049. did begin to raiſe up the State of Cardinals at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Unto whom afterwards <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. about the year 1244. gave the priviledge of the Red Hat, Of the Scarlet Gown, And to go on Horſeback through the Citie.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And in the year 1470. <hi>Paul</hi> the 2. did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. And ſince <hi>Clement</hi> the 5. went ſo far in his <hi>Clementines,</hi> as to make them march before all the Princes of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But that the beginning of Cardinals had been ſuch, as hath been repreſented: Beſides the conſent of the whole Hiſtory, it doth appear by the following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth appear by this; That Antiently there were onely 28 of them, That is to ſay, as many as of Titles, and of the pariſhes at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That doth appear by this, That as the Popes were willing to make a great number of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, they did alſo increaſe the number of the Pariſhes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That doth appear by this, That above a thouſand years laſting, the leaſt Biſhop had the precedence of a Cardinal; how Ancient ſoever he might be: And even the Dean likewiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That doth appear by this, That the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalat was a Degree to become Biſhop; And that he who of a Cardinal was made Biſhop, did ceaſe to be Cardinal, which was not altered but about the year 1190, by <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the third.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That doth appear by this, That among the Cardinal Biſhops, the Precedence was taken from the Promotion to the Biſhoprick, and not to the Cardinalſhip. The Cardinals being eſteemed inferiours to Biſhops, and onely more then ſimple Prieſts. <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. did change that, after he had troden under feet the Emperor <hi>Frederick,</hi> about the year 1180. making thenceforth the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93664:55"/>Cardinals Biſhops, and the Cardinals not Biſhops, to have the precedence of Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Primates, Patriarchs, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That doth appear by this, That the Church of <hi>Ravenna</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> had her Cardinals, and kept them a long time; which alſo in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great did maintain, That ſhe held nothing of Rome.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Concerning Cardinal Deacons, the books of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do teach us, That there was but one there in the beginning; which was called ſo, becauſe he was the Principal Deacon, (called by us Arch-Deacon) of the ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons that were in that City: that is to ſay, one for two Regions, which were called Regionarie Deacons, having the care of the Alms.</p>
                  <p>Since they were 14, one for a Region, and afterwards 18. To give 4 of them to <hi>Latran.</hi> and at laſt they were all Cardinals, and that without Number.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It muſt not be wondred at, Then if the Canoniſts do Diſpute, that the Cardinals have no Rank in the Church, and that they are neither Inſtituted by Chriſt, nor by his Apoſtles, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Neither alſo muſt we wonder, if even the Cardinal of <hi>Alliaco,</hi> among the Articles which he preſented to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Libr. de Reform.</note> at the Requeſt of the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> did give counſel to extinguiſh them, as ſuperfluous, and added without cauſe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OF them doth Chriſt our Saviour ſpeak, Matth. 24.24. in theſe words, <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns, and wonders, inſomuch, that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:93664:62"/>Of them alſo doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak, 2 Theſſ. 2.9. in theſe words, <hi>Even him, (namely Antichriſt) whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders.</hi> Of them likewiſe doth S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeak, Apoc. 13.14. in theſe words, <hi>And them that dwell on the earth, (meaning Antichriſt) by the means of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he had power to do in the ſight of the Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Popes, which are that Antichriſt, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Gift of Miracles, hath noiſed more of them then any other Religion; Either the True, Or the Falſe Religion.</p>
                  <p>More then <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician did.</p>
                  <p>More then <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath done.</p>
                  <p>More then <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other Prophets have done.</p>
                  <p>Nay more then Chriſt hath done, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, although they have made of them in great Number.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it not the moſt ordinarie Subject of the Legends of the Saints: by which, in time paſt, the Preachers of the Church of Rome, did ſo beat the ears of their Auditors.</p>
                  <p>It is true, That ſince the Reformation of the Chriſtians, thoſe Legends are not ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but ſtill Citations are made out of them, although not ſo commonly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But theſe Miracles, boaſted by thoſe of the Church of Rome, were not true, but lying Miracles. And that in regard of all manners and kinds of Cauſes.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:93664:63"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Falſe in regard of the efficient Cauſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were wrought by Satan, who is the father of Lyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Falſe in regard of the final Cauſe, Becauſe they were done to introduce a falſe Doctrine, and full of Lyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Falſe in regard of the Material Cauſe, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of them are but Illuſions, and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. Not true Reſurrections of ſome Dead, as they are pretended to be. Neither alſo curing of ſome Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Falſe in regard of the Formal Cauſe, For if ſome of theſe Miracles are true, in reſpect of the Matter, they ſhall not be ſo in regard of the Form, becauſe they ſhall not be above the ſtrength of Nature, as are all the true Miracles, but ſhall be wrought by Natural Cauſes, Either Manifeſt, or Hidden.</p>
                  <p>Satan applying Active Things to Paſſives, They may be wondrous things, but not Miracles, which are wrought onely by the Omnipotencie of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And notwithſtanding that, God having ſo permitted it, thoſe falſe Miracles did ſerve to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, and ſettle many Errors.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this Means the Popes, and their Clergie did endeavour to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; Sometimes ſaying, that Beaſts did leave their Food to worſhip the Hoſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, That the Hoſt being pricked, ſome blood came out of it. That a part thereof being fallen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93664:63"/>in the water, when the Prieſt waſhed his hands, all the water had been changed into blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this Means alſo the Pope, and his Clergy did eſtabliſh, The Interceſſion, Adoration, and Invocation of the departed Saints. And upon that, How many Miracles have been boaſted of. Namely That many blind do recover their ſight, Many lame do go, That many ſick do recover health.</p>
                  <p>If any Mineral Waters be found in a Country that have ſome virtue, there a Chappel of ſome Saint is builded, unto whom the virtue of theſe waters is attributed, which is called by the Name of Miracle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this Means likewiſe hath been eſtabliſhed the Adoration of Images; being ſaid, that in certain places the Crucifix being ill uſed by the Jewes, did render Bloud. Alſo, that in another place, a Child without Feet having vowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Image was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in the place where he was Born, did ſee in ſleeping his two Feet be given unto him. That in ſome other Places ſome Images did render Oyle like unto Sweat, which did ſerve for the Cure of many Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this Means beſides hath been eſtabliſhed the veneration of Relicks.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And for the Admiration of the Dignity of Popes, this Means hath been alſo uſed.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is that which is repreſented in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe</hi> chap. 17.6. In theſe words, <hi>And I ſaw the woman drunken with the bloud of the Saints, and with the Bloud of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi> And in the 12. Chapter all along Particularly, and Expreſſely in the verſes, 13, 15, and 17. of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is gone farre above the Cruelty of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, and that of the moſt wild and Barbarous of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Cruelty, and Perſecution hath been exerciſed, and tried by the Popes, &amp; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all the places where the Reformed Religion was Imbraced.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And if at this Time it doth not appear ſo violent, as in time paſt; It is becauſe the ſtrength of Antichriſt weakenth, and not his will.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BEcauſe, ſay they, there is but ſmall hope of their Converſion; Hereticks being very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and whatſoever is done to exhort them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93664:64"/>to Repentance, being by them attributed to the want of ſtrength to force them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there was not any Remembrance that ever Moderation had done any good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that Experience had ſhewed, that the ſooner it is proceeded againſt them by the Juſtice and the Executions thereof, it fareth the better.</p>

               <p n="3">3. It were tedious to recite the Horrible Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, The Fearful Burnings, and the Exquiſite Puniſhments that the Papiſts have exerciſed in thoſe States.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Sword, The Rack, The Gallows, and the Fire, have been the Inſtruments of their Cruelty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And had it not been for theſe, the Church of Rome had been overthrown long ago. For by

               <p n="1">1. THe firſt Reaſon is the Teſtament of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> wherein he diſpoſed the whole Empire, and divided it among his three Sonnes; To <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Conſtans,</hi> was attributed, (ſaith <hi>Zonaras,</hi>) <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Africk, Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Cottian Alpes, Cum Galliis</hi> with the Countries of the <hi>Galles:</hi> To <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed that which was in the <hi>East.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is credible, that if <hi>Constantine</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, either by Word, or Writing, an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Donation of <hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Provinces to the Pope, and that ſo ſolemnly, That as <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. ſaith, <hi>He Decreed that Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to abide firm, and inviolable,</hi> in finem mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, <hi>unto the end of the world.</hi> It is credible we ſay, that ſo pious, and prudent an Emperour would within twelve years after, do contrary to his own Act, eſpecially in his laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, wherein he would rather have teſtified his Religious affection, and love to the Church, by an Addition of ſome other gift, then leave ſo eternal a blemiſh upon his Name.</p>

               <p>And of making his own children inheritors of that which he knew was neither his to give: Nor which they, without open Injuſtice, Impiety, and Sacriledge, might accept, hold, or poſſeſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon is, the perpetual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and dominion, which the Emperours had of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>Italy,</hi> with the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which Continued ſtill in them.

               <p n="3">3. The third proof, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made no ſuch Donation, is the Teſtimonie of their own Writers.</p>

               <head>The Charter, or Edict of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Donation, is a baſe, and improbable Fiction.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL that which is proved by Reformed Writers, of the ſuppoſed Leproſie, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and Baptiſm of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by Pope <hi>Sylvester,</hi> are undoubted Demonſtrations of the Forgerie of this Edict of Donation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For in the Charter are all theſe, Not onely related as certain truths, but they are made the very ground and occaſion why <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made this Charter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing then there is neither truth nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93664:69"/>in the foundation; Certainly there is no truth at all in the Charter it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But leaving theſe we will propoſe a few other Conſiderations in this Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this Edict is mentioned the See of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> as one of the Patriarchal Sees. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, neither it had Patriarchal Dignitie, before the Second General Council, (that is more then fiftie years after the Donation is ſuppoſed to be made) Nor was there at that time ſo much as the name of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> For this City was then called <hi>Byzantium.</hi> And divers years after, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had much enlarged it, and made it, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Parem, &amp; aequalem Romae,</hi> equal to <hi>Rome,</hi> chooſing it for the Imperial Seat.</p>
               <p>It was then firſt called by his Name <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> And this was done, as <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, a little after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was ended.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Sigonius</hi> more truely teacheth, five years after that <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, when <hi>Gallicanus</hi> and <hi>Symachus</hi> were Conſuls.</p>
               <p>So very ſtupid was the forgerer, that to gain to the Pope, &amp; to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> principality over <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he makes <hi>Conſtantine</hi> write of that City which was not; no nor the name of it ſo much as extant in the World at that time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had <hi>Conſtantine</hi> given principality to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, above all Churches in the World, as the Charter ſaith he did, What folly was it in <hi>John,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93664:70"/>in others, to ſtrive for that Preheminence? What meant <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, that he would never ſhew this Charter, and grant of principalitie made by <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why did he uſe ſo much intreaty and means to <hi>Phocas</hi> a murtherer, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might be called the firſt of all Churches; when the ſame was long, almoſt 300. years before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a fair Charter to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> ſo Worthy, and Renowned an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this Edict <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is made ſolemnly to give unto Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace; whereas, not only <hi>Sigonius</hi> witneſſeth that this was given long before to Pope <hi>Meltiades: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stale Palatium in Laterano impertiit; Conſtantine</hi> gave to <hi>Meltiades</hi> the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace: but <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Binnius</hi> avouch the ſame for a certainty, and ſay, <hi>that no wiſe body will doubt thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Auguſtiſſimae Lateranenſes Aedes,</hi> ſay they, That moſt princely Palace of the <hi>Lateran</hi> was given by the ſame <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to Pope <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades,</hi> the Predeceſſor of <hi>Sylvester,</hi> and to his Succeſſors; and that in the Seventh year of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> which was twelve years before he was either Baptized, or made this Charter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Is not this now a piece of great munificence in the Emperour, to give that, which it is not his own to give; or to give that to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which many years before that gift was <hi>Sylveſters</hi> own, and his Succeſſours for ever.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:93664:70"/>
               <p n="4">4. To the above ſaid conſiderations, let us add the Teſtimony of their great Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> to whom accords <hi>Gretſer,</hi> who hath written an Apologie for him in this very point. He by many Reaſons, and at large, proves the Edict to be <hi>Commentitium, prorſuſque falſum,</hi> A meer Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Forgerie. And as <hi>Gretſer</hi> ſaith, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis accenſendum docuit.</hi> He hath taught, that it is a Counterfeit. One Reaſon is, That this Edict was not in the Ancient Acts of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> but was by forgerie inſerted into them.</p>
               <p>The time when this was done, he defines to have been after the 1000 year of Chriſt. The Parties by whom this forged Edict was made, and publiſhed, he alſo declares. It was fained by ſome <hi>Grecian,</hi> under the name of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and ſet forth by <hi>Theodorus Balſamon:</hi> whereas <hi>a nullo Graecorum hactenus in lucem editum,</hi> until then no <hi>Grecian</hi> had publiſhed it. And from the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> it came to the <hi>Latins</hi> and Weſtern Church. <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. being the firſt Pope, who makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Thus the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>By whoſe acknowledgment it may be ſeen, what truth there is in the Popes; ſpecially in Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who in his Decretal Epiſtle, moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly commends this Edict, for an Ancient, and undoubted Evidence. Such as he knew by ſight, and ſenſe to be the true deed of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Which yet their great Cardinal after long ſifting of Monuments, and Records, teſtifieth to be a Forgerie; and that of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Firſt of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93664:71"/>all deviſed, as he ſaith about 700. years, and publiſhed 800. years after the Death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</hi>
               </p>

Then there are none ſo abominable Hereſies, nor any ſo monſtrous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which may not boaſt, although wrongfully, to have the word of God for its Ground. So for Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Heretick <hi>Arrians</hi> could ſay, That they were grounded upon the Word of God, becauſe there is no paſſage, which formally ſaith, That the Son is conſubſtantial to the Father; and that it is not a Created God.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Neſtoreans</hi> alſo could ſay, That they were grounded upon the Word of God, becauſe there is no formal place which ſaies, That in Jeſus Chriſt there are not two Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So much could ſay the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> For there are no places which formally ſaies, That the two Natures of Chriſt be not confuſed: and that the Human Nature hath not ſwallowed up by the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Likewiſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> who reject Jeſus Chriſt, with a prodigious obſtinacie, could ſay, That they were grounded upon the Word of God, becauſe that in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in all the Prophets, there is not any place which ſaith formally, That Jeſus, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> is the Meſſias.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In a word, the Religion of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> could be ſaid to be grounded upon the Word of God; For there is no Text in the Bible, which ſaith that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is a falſe Prophet, and that his Religion is impious, and abominable; and that the Paradiſe which God promiſeth to his children, is not a carnal Paradiſe.</p>

               <head>THESIS. <hi>Of the Reformation of the Church in general.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. VVHen the Church is infected with Errors in the Doctrine, or loaded with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Ceremonies, or Governed by an evil Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Policie, the Reformation thereof is not permitted to the People without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Prince, and Soveraign Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuch a Reformation is to be made by the Prince and Soveraign, as being a Right which belongeth unto him, and which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him by Divine and Humane Right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither alſo is it lawful to a Miniſter of a particular Church to change at his will the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of his Church, but if they are not to be tolerated, he muſt with his Church make his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93664:88"/>Addreſſes to the Supream Magiſtrate to obtain from him the neceſſary Reformation of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Prince being to imploy himſelf about the Reformation of the Church when ſhe hath need of a Reformation, ought to that effect to conſult the Divines of his Countrey, the moſt Learned, the moſt Prudent, and the moſt Godly, and to convoke a National Synod compoſed of ſuch Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It will be well done alſo by him to join unto his own Divines the Divines of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that by that Means greater weight may be given to the Reformation which he will effect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Divines aſſembled muſt carefully ſeek out the Truth, and when they have found it, the Prince ought to ordain and injoin the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſaid National Synod, or Aſſembly of Divines, ought to extend the Reformation of the Church to four Heads, namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the Doctrine concerning Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Divine Worſhip, and Service.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Ceremonies, and outward things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the Eccleſiaſtical Policy, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And in regard of the aboveſaid four Heads, the ſaid Synod or Aſſembly of Divines ought to Reform the Church according to the beſt Form of all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now a better Form of the Church cannot
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93664:88"/>be conceived, nor found than that according to which Jeſus Chriſt by himſelf, and by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did in the beginning eſtabliſh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Church.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Which hath been the Form of the Church in the Times of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, we learn it clearly out of the Books of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably out of the Writings of the Doctors of the Church who lived immediately after the death of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="11">11. According to this Form the Church ought to be Reformed in regard of the above named four Heads, bringing them back to the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and to the firſt Springs; Thas is to ſay, to the firſt Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="12">12, If it happens that between ſome National Reformed Churches there be a difference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Ceremonies, and outward things, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well together in regard of the Doctrine; for ſuch a difference in Ceremonies the ſaid Churches muſt not be enemies one to the others. But they ought to bear one another Charitably, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="4">4. It muſt firſt appear that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the Catholique Church, otherwiſe the Reformed cannot be convicted of Schiſme.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the time of <hi>Optatus</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Preſerver of Religion, the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the True Faith, and ſhe ſhined like a Star in the ſight of all other Churches.</p>

Theſe be their words, <hi>We would have healed Babylon, but ſhe is not healed, forſake her, and let us go every one into his own Countrey:</hi> So the Apoſtles did not ſeparate themſelves from the Jews to turn towards the Gentiles but after that they had rejected their word, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It hath been for that, and after the ſame proceeding, that our Fathers by thouſands did ſeparate themſelves from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For which Retreat and Separation we are wrongfully accuſed of Schiſm, for it is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is Schiſmatick, and not our Churches, becauſe ſhe hath given the Cauſe, and the neceſſity to our Separation.</p>

               <head>Of the Contentions, and Differences, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Church about Religion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is the craft and practice of Sathan, ſworn enemy to Chriſt, and to his Church, to riſe and excite Contentions and Differences in the ſame. He ſowes his Tares in the Field of the Lord, and at the coming up of the Heavenly Doctrine, he raiſes great Fogs, as ſome do riſe, at the riſing of the Sun.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which he doth to hinder to his utmoſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the vertue and efficacy of the ſaid Divine Doctrine, and to maintain his Kingdom, which is not deſtroyed by any thing ſo much as by preaching of the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the beginning of the Chriſtian Church, we have ſome examples of ſuch differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences among the Faithful; Then there was a great controverſie concerning the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.5.</note> ſome thought it needful to keep them, and others were againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Since Diviſions and Differences are alſo crept in the Churches, which were founded by the Apoſtles, in the time of <hi>Irencus,</hi> what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was it between the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, concerning the time of the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or <hi>Paſch,</hi> and how long did it laſt.</p>
               <p>The Eaſtern Churches maintaining that it was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93664:123"/>to be kept, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did the fourteenth day of the Moneth, after the Equinox of the Spring; And the Weſtern onely the Sunday following. In the time of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Council of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> had a belief quite contrary to that of the other Churches. Having decreed that thoſe ſhould be rebaptized, who before had been baptized by Hereticks. Is it not alſo that which by the craft of the ſame Enemy is happened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the laſt Reformation of the Church, when then the firſt Reformers did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves about the Diſcovery and Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; on one ſide the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> did ariſe in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and with a wonderful fury oppoſing the Power, and Authority of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide the Sacramentary War did become hot. That is to ſay, the difference concerning the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt. Is it not beſides, that which ſince ſome years, we have ſeen in this Church and State, where the <hi>Arminians</hi> did trouble the peace of both? And now it is troubled by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Separatiſts, Antinomians,</hi> and by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other dangerous Sects.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now when we ſay that Satan is the cauſe of the contentions, and differences which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Church; We do not mean that he be the onely cauſe of them. For it is certain that there are ſome other.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:93664:124"/>
               <p>As, 1. Pride, and Self-love.</p>
               <p>And, 2. Ignorance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride, and Self-love is a firebrand of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diſcord, whereas on the contrary, Humility entertains peace and concord; For Humility ſeeks the laſt places, for which there is no debate, and ſo peace is conſerved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ignorance alſo is a great cauſe of contentions and differences; For the Faithful may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of many things, and yet be too-confident in their knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="exercitation">
               <head>Of the Troubles and Contentions, which happens in the Church about Religion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is a thing which is to be noted, that the contentions and differences which happens in the Church, commonly begins by the moſt weak and ignorant; but who with their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, are ſtubborn and obſtinate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon thereof is rendered by S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> who ſayes that there is nothing more audacious, than ignorance, and that there is none ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crime, but that it hath the boldneſs to reach unto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So do we read, <hi>John</hi> the third, 25, 26. that the contention which was moved between the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the <hi>Jews</hi> which followed Chriſt, did firſt ariſe from the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> who were rude and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men; As it is to be ſeen in the Hiſtory of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93664:124"/>the Goſpel, and particularly in the Anſwer of <hi>John</hi> their Maſter which he gave unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And this is too much confirmed by the Examples of the dangerous contentions moved in theſe times, by the dangerous ſects of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> Of all Sectaries none are ſo ignorant as they, and yet none ſo quarrelſome, and who are the firſt to debate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are like unto <hi>Sarah, Abrahams</hi> Wife, who in the difference concerning <hi>Hagar,</hi> although ſhe was the weakeſt, and had the wrong on her ſide, <hi>Yet ſhe did riſe againſt</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>her Husband, and ſaid unto him, the Lord judge between me and thee,</hi> Gen. 16.5.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="exercitation">
               <head>Of the Remedy to the Contentions and Differences, which happen in the Church about Religion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WE read, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5, &amp; 6. that the way which the Apoſtles and the Elders did take to compoſe the great diſſention which was ariſed touching Circumciſion, was to meet in Council, for to conſider of this Matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which is a commendable way, and moſt fit to compoſe differences and contentions, when ſome are happened in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore which ought to be the way, that the Prince, and Supream Magiſtrate moſt uſe, when ſome happens in the Churches of his States and Dominions; Then he muſt aſſemble a Synod, or Council, as he calls a Parliament
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93664:125"/>to compoſe the civil differences, and to order the things belonging to the State.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So did the Apoſtles, as hath been ſaid; ſo did afterwards the Primitive Church; And ſo did the Antient Emperours, who did deſire the Union of the Church which did ſucceed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well unto them; For as by the Council of the Apoſtles was decided and compoſed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning Circumciſion, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. So the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did condemn the Heretick <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who denied the Divinity of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did condemn the Heretick <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denied the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> did condemn <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who denied the Unity of the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did condemn the Heretick <hi>Eutiches,</hi> who confounded the two Natures of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An Univerſal council is moſt uſeful when it can be called, and aſſembled; But it is not abſolutely neceſſary for the conſervation and maintenance of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And therefore National Churches may commodiouſly enough be Ruled and Governed, by National Synods.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For that cauſe, and in that regard, the care of the Prince, and Soveraign Magiſtrate ought to be, that ſuch a National Synod be
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93664:125"/>ſettled, and eſtabliſhed in the National Churches of his Dominions, and States.</p>

               <p n="6">6. But for that they are not abſolutely to be aboliſhed; but the reading of them is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Learned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which we prove by the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>

               </p>
               <p>The 2. Argument is taken from the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Utilities which proceeds from the reading of ſuch Books. In the Books of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſuch things are written, by which the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies themſelves are confuted. Beſides, it is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to know what is happened in every Age.</p>
               <p>The 3. Argument is this, Which of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath been free from all kind of Errors: And in the Books of the Gentiles, and of the Jews many things are contained contrary to the true Chriſtian Faith, and yet we do not aboliſh them.</p>

               <head>The Jewes ſhall be converted to Christ before the End of the World.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe Scripture hath determined, that this Converſion of the Jewes ſhall be; that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved,</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">3. All that we dare ſay of it, is by way of probability.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it may be compriſed in the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Converſion of the Jewes is not as yet paſt; for though ſome be here and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, yet the promiſe being more general, is not yet fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will not be long before the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93664:145"/>of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but toward the latter end of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor when that day ſhall be; that is to ſay, when God will convert this Nation, or come in the Clouds of Heaven to Judge the Earth, no man can tell: <hi>It is not for us to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power,</hi> Acts 1.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we ſay ſo little of ſo great a Point, our Apologie is, that of what we know not, we ſpeak not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If any man out of a proud ſpirit, for oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhall take upon him to determine the time, we profeſſe that we believe him not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We diſpute not whether they ſhall have a Policy, and ſhall recover the holy Land, and dwell there; for it is likely they ſhall never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, becauſe we find no ſuch promiſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="exercitation">
               <head>We must have pity and compaſſion of the blindneſs of the Jews, and pray God earnestly, that they may be enlightned with the ſaving knowledge of God, his Chriſt, and holy Goſpel.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FOr if their Caſe be to be pitied and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who through bodily blindneſſe run into innumerable miſchiefs, and fall at laſt into a deep gulph without hope of recovery; how much more ſhould we pity and bewail their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, who through ſpiritual blindneſs plunge themſelves for the preſent into far greater
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93664:146"/>evils, and at laſt fall irrecoverably into the Pit of everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither let their fury and faultineſſe in oppoſing Chriſt in his truth and members, leſſen our pity, but rather encreaſe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For what can they doe otherwiſe, ſo long as they are under this heavy Judgement of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual blindneſſe; who is angry with a blind man becauſe he goeth out of his way, or ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at every block, or falleth into every pit and ditch? yea, who doth not pity him in all, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe miſeries, and laboureth not that he may either prevent, or be delivered out of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And how much more then ſhould we ſtand thus affected towards thoſe who lie under the puniſhments of ſpiritual blindneſſe and phrenſie, which without all compariſon are greater than the other, and much more deſperate and durable.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And on the other ſide the Libertinage of the Proteſtants, and their profane Life, and bad Converſation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For when the Jews do ſee that the Papiſts believes not well, and that the Proteſtants live
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93664:146"/>not wel, it is a Rock of offence to them, that they can approve neither the one, nor the other.</p>
